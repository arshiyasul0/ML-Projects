 Diamond Price Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Project

  This repository contains a Google Colab notebook developed to predict the prices of diamonds based on their attributes using machine learning algorithms.

 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict diamond prices based on features like carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions.

Technologies Used
 - Python
 - Google Colab
 - pandas â€“ data manipulation
 - numpy â€“ numerical operations
 - matplotlib & seaborn â€“ data visualization
 - scikit-learn â€“ machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)

Files Included
  - `diamond_price_prediction.ipynb` â€“ main notebook with data preprocessing, model training, evaluation

 Features
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature encoding and scaling
  - Model training and evaluation (RÂ², MAE, MSE)
  - Visualizations for insights
